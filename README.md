#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6YiyP2a2Pc&t=8s 
#### Description:
The name of this web application is called My Time - My Responsibility and it is built as my CS50 final project. 
As the name suggests, the theme of this web application is time management. Many successful individuals emphasize the importance of time management in order to be more productive. This give me the idea to build this application which will serve as a platform for users to plan and organize their day. The server side of this application is built using Python with Flask and the database used is Sqlite3. Javascript and jQuery are used to make the application more dynamic and interactive while CSS to make it more appealing. This is my very first self-built web application and I have deployed it using pythonanywhere, welcome to give my application a try by following this link, mytime-myresponsibility .
so i want to talk a bit about time management and productivity How well do you manage your time?
Think about – its Friday afternoon and 5 o’clock is fast approaching – time to
go home. You are working fast to complete that report before the five o’clock
deadline. Inside, you are silently cursing yourself for not starting the report
sooner – after all, you have had the whole month to write it.
How did that happen? What went wrong? Were that busy that you did not
have time to spare to write the report? Why did you lose focus?
The truth is, you had ample time on your hands – 24/7 for a whole month.
Much of your time went into re-reading emails and overanalyzing them,
shopping online, gossiping on WhatsApp, watching Tik Tok and checking
other social media posts, excessive coffee breaks, and working on less
important tasks with a longer deadline.
If this sounds familiar, then you know you are a victim of procrastination.
One thing you must note is that this is a trap many of us fall into often.
According to research, at least 95% of people procrastinate to a certain
extent. You may be thinking, "Well, how bad can it be? After all, I am not
alone!" What you need to realize is that this habit is the reason you have not
achieved your goals. In other words, procrastination is holding you back from
reaching your fullest potential.
I hear most people asking whether procrastination is the same as being lazy.
Well, the truth is, these two are very different! Understand that
procrastination is an active process. You are choosing to do something else
when you know you should be doing a particular task. Laziness, on the other
hand, is a lack of willingness to act – apathy or inactivity.
Take a minute to think about all the tasks on your to-do list – are there tasks
you have been ignoring but are highly important and urgent – even though
they are unpleasant?
You need to realize that when you yield to the impulse of doing tasks that are
more enjoyable yet less important over those that are most important and
urgent, you set yourself up for serious consequences. This can be the reason
for your shame, guilt, or lower productivity levels, hence missing out on
accomplishing your set goals.
Postponing things over extended durations can be demotivating and causeyou to be disillusioned on other tasks. This contributes to depression and
even job loss.
Take inventory of what you have been procrastinating on. Are you one of
those who say, "I do better or work best under pressure?" Those who say this
habitually procrastinate important tasks they planned to implement or had
enough time to review before the deadline. In other words, they cannot make
an accurate comparison of the circumstances they work well under pressure.
Procrastination does not equal working best under pressure.
That said, procrastination is not a matter of poor time management skills.
However, it can be traced to more complex underlying psychological reasons.
The dynamics are worsened by situations when one is constantly evaluated.
For instance, a student may feel the pressure for grades that are riding on
their performance while for an employer, it is the pressure for promotion.
In reality, procrastination is a self-protection strategy.
In most cases, when you postpone tasks, you are tempted to give the excuse
of "having an insufficient amount of time" so that in case you fail, it is not
your ability that is threatened. When one is under the pressure of getting good
grades or reaching targets and getting that long-awaited promotion, there is a
chance that they try to avoid the tasks. But why is that the case? To some
part, it is because of fear and anxiety of not doing well, losing control,
looking stupid, or having a low sense of self-esteem.
You postpone tasks because you are afraid your abilities will be questioned,
and, if you succeed, we feel "smarter."
So, what can we do to overcome procrastination?
so you can use app like this to overcome procastination and manage time effectively

I have posted a video on youtube introducing this web application. Feel free to have a look through this link, video, and I am more than happy to hear from you guys! Cheers 

Future Work
It will be better if this application has notification functions, where it can send desktop notification to the user 5 minutes before the task begins and ends.
More flexible in term of planning and organizing (Currently the application only allows users to plan for "today" not "tomorrow" and the time blocks has been fixed at one hour interval starting from 8am to 10pm).
Aesthetic, it might not look "great" now!
